To-Do and Reminders for hexdump implementation for Windows
===============================================================================================

High Priority
* Plan out the structure of the program (to the best of your ability) so that you're working towards
  something coherent.
* Fix the messy piles of garbage that the print-Endian functions are (Namely, replace atrocious multi-counter
  for loops with easier to read and maintain loops).
* Implement command-line arguments.
* Implement the ability to export results to files. 
* Remove magic numbers and unnamed constants.

Low(er) Priority
* Improve the program's output (try experimenting with colors) -- make it more attractive.
* Add documentation explaining decisions that aren't obvious.
